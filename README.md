# Digital Audio Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) Simulation

##  Project Overview

This project implements digital audio signal upconversion, frequency-division multiplexing (FDM), and downconversion using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) principles.

The work is based on fundamental concepts from Signals and Systems, including:

- Nyquist–Shannon Sampling Theorem  
- Carrier frequency modulation  
- Frequency shifting using complex exponentials  
- Audio bandwidth allocation  
- Zero-padding and signal alignment  
- Multiplexing and demultiplexing of multiple audio channels  

Three audio signals are upconverted to different carrier frequencies, multiplexed into a single composite signal, and later recovered using downconversion and filtering.
